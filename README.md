# MASDERtools

## Installation

This package is not yet on CRAN; we aim to submit it to CRAN sometime in 2022. For now, install the latest version of the package by running this code:

```{r}
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("SDSattitudes/MASDERtools")
```

If you do not have the devtools package, install it with `install.packages("devtools")` in the usual way.

## Status

The package is in a functional state for performing some standard analyses on S-SOMAS data. In addition to adding new features and fixing bugs, the documentation needs to be improved. This is a task that would be reasonable for any student to contribute to - if you are interested, contact Doug.

A vignette has been created to show off some of the core features of the package.
