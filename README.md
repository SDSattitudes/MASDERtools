# MASDERtools

## Installation

This package is not yet on CRAN; we aim to submit it to CRAN sometime in 2022. For now, install the latest version of the package by running this code:

```{r}
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("SDSattitudes/MASDERtools")
```

If you do not have the devtools package, install it with `install.packages("devtools")` in the usual way.
